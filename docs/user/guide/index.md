# Use the Web UI

Start the Web UI through the [root README](../../../README.md#run); the command prints its URL. This guide begins after that server is running. The `kh` process uses its invoking directory as the default filesystem location, but a fresh Web UI has no selected workspace until you add one.

## Configure a model

Open **Settings → Models** and save a provider. OpenAI, OpenRouter, a local OpenAI-compatible server, and a DeepSeek API key are separate routes; none is selected until you save one. The model route becomes usable on the next request without restarting the server.

The [model configuration guide](./providers.md) covers those providers, Claude Code and Codex delegation, and why GitHub Copilot is not a chat route.

## Choose a workspace

Click **Choose workspace**, add the project directory where you started `kh`, and select it. The session composer remains unavailable until a workspace is selected.

## Run a task

Start a session and send:

> Summarize this repository and identify its main packages.

The agent can read and edit workspace files, run commands, delegate work, and maintain a plan. The Web UI asks before operations that require approval under the active permission policy.
