# Metadata and links

## Summary

README metadata is a retrieval and template-selection interface, not a miniature report or advertisement. The `kind` field selects exactly one README template that exists in this skill and maps to the document standard; the frontmatter carries no field that a filename convention or an executed gate already owns. Documentation is English only. Link syntax must render correctly on GitHub and the documentation site, so repository links stay renderer-valid relative URLs.

## README metadata

Start every authored README with YAML frontmatter. Permit custom fields, but keep common fields stable enough for search and indexing.

```yaml
---
description: "Example capability for users and maintainers choosing, configuring, or debugging the package."
kind: "package-reference"
---
```

`description` and `kind` are required for package READMEs. The page title and package manifest already own the name, while the document job and its reader path express the audience; duplicating either in frontmatter adds no retrieval value. Do not add `tags` until a repository-owned taxonomy and search consumer justify them beyond description and full-text search. Keep keys lowercase and hyphenated unless an existing owner defines another spelling, and do not copy volatile code inventories into frontmatter.

## The kind system

`kind` selects the document template directly; every kind maps to exactly one template that exists in this skill, and no template exists without a kind. Files named `docs/persistence-changes/YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md` use `persistence-change`; files named `docs/persistence-changes/releases/kh-v*.md` use `persistence-release`. Files named `docs/persistence-changes/historical-formats/vN.md` use `persistence-format`. Files named `docs/upgrade-guide/v<version>/<item>/guide.md` use `upgrade-guide`. Folder READMEs are indexes, not records. Derive package README kinds mechanically, in this order:

1. The README is `packages/README.md` or `packages/<group>/README.md` → `package-group`.
2. The package manifest declares `kh.bundle.patch` → `package-bundle`.
3. The package is in the audited library registry of `scripts/doc-standard.spec.ts` → `package-library`.
4. Everything else — a service default export or an `apply` plugin — is `package-reference`.

| `kind` | Repository position | Template | Standard |
|---|---|---|---|
| `package-group` | `packages/README.md`, `packages/<group>/README.md` | [package-group.md](../templates/package-group.md) | Group map: orient the capability family, map its direct packages, explain composition relationships, and link package-owned details. |
| `package-reference` | `packages/<group>/<package>/README.md` with a plugin entry | [package-reference.md](../templates/package-reference.md) | Package contract: follow the [package README review standard](review.md#package-readme-review) and the canonical [package documentation requirements](../../../../docs/cookbook/adding-a-package.md#4-write-the-package-readme). |
| `package-library` | `packages/<group>/<package>/README.md` with a plain module entry | [package-library.md](../templates/package-library.md) | Library contract: consumer entry points and boundaries; no profile-install path and no mount configuration. |
| `package-bundle` | `packages/<group>/<package>/README.md` declaring `kh.bundle.patch` | [package-bundle.md](../templates/package-bundle.md) | Installable layer: the verified `kh plugin` install path, layer semantics, and patch document. |
| `persistence-change` | `docs/persistence-changes/YYYY-MM-DD-slug.md` | [persistence-change.md](../templates/persistence-change.md) | Historical acknowledgement: mechanically detected type changes, per-root predecessor references, compatibility decision, and generated after schemas. |
| `persistence-release` | `docs/persistence-changes/releases/kh-v*.md` | [persistence-release.md](../templates/persistence-release.md) | Retrospective observation: pinned tag, adjacent before/after digests, actual version constants, and changed after schemas; no compatibility acknowledgement. |
| `persistence-format` | `docs/persistence-changes/historical-formats/vN.md` | [persistence-format.md](../templates/persistence-format.md) | Selected historical format: source evidence, complete root schemas and reachable types; the current writer uses the generated catalog. |
| `upgrade-guide` | `docs/upgrade-guide/v<version>/<item>/guide.md` | [upgrade-guide.md](../templates/upgrade-guide.md) | Upgrade path: one externally perceptible break from the directory's release to the next, with `Change` and `Migration` sections in at most 500 English words. |

Before assigning `package-library` or `package-bundle`, inspect the facts: read `package.json` for `kh.bundle.patch` and `src/index.ts` for the entry shape (`apply` export or a default service export is a plugin; a plain module API is a library). `kh plugin --profile <name> add <package>` installs any npm dependency, but the profile reconcile activates a layer only for a package that declares `kh.bundle`; never present that command as an install path for a library or a plain plugin. The documentation check derives the expected kind from these same facts, rejects another value, and rejects `name`, `audience`, `tags`, and README-local `i18n` metadata. Add a new kind only with a distinct template, an unambiguous repository position or declared owner, and a focused check that maps documents to it.

## Description quality

Agents search frontmatter `description` values to shortlist pages before loading full documents. Write each value like a Skill description: state what the page covers and when a reader should open it. Use one or two concrete sentences, include searchable domain terms, and distinguish the page from nearby owners. Do not summarize every section, claim superiority, repeat the title, advertise vaguely, preserve change history, or write a technical status report.

Good: `The shipped JSONL session-persistence backend for deployments and maintainers choosing, configuring, or debugging per-session durable logs with optional Zstandard compression.`

Weak: `The best and most advanced session storage implementation with lots of optimizations.`

## Repository links and path mentions

Keep link destinations machine-checkable and mentions context-relative. Use fragment-only links for the current page's menu. Use full URLs for external resources.

The desired internal-link model names a target from the repository root, but a leading `/docs/...` Markdown URL resolves outside the repository on GitHub, remains untouched by the website projector, and is skipped by `verify-md-links`. Until a repository-owned resolver supports root paths in every renderer, use the current renderer-valid relative URL in Markdown links and write logical path mentions such as `docs/` or `packages/session/` relative to the discussion. Never adopt an unchecked leading-slash link merely to resemble an absolute path.

## English documentation

Write documentation in English. Do not add `*.zh.md` pages or `*.i18n.yaml` pairing records. `verify-translation-pairing` rejects those files and rejects an English page that links to them. Point relative links at the English `.md` target. Do not hard-wrap prose. Keep code blocks byte-identical.

## Dev Note

None.
