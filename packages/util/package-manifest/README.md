## Summary

Use `KhPackageManifest` for package metadata, `KhManifest` for the public fields under `kh`, and member types such as `KhClientManifest` for one domain. Each reader owns JSON parsing, validation, and default resolution.

## Use this package

Import from the package root. Use a development dependency when only checking your own source; use a production dependency if your published declarations reference these types.

```ts
import type { KhClientManifest, KhPackageManifest } from '@kinetick-labs/kh-package-manifest'

const client: KhClientManifest = { platform: 'web' }
const manifest: KhPackageManifest = {
  name: 'example-kh-plugin',
  version: '1.0.0',
  engines: { node: '>=24', kh: '0.1.5-alpha.1' },
  kh: {
    manifestVersion: 1,
    bundle: { patch: './cordis.patch.yml' },
    client,
  },
}
```

`KhPackageManifest` describes the package.json fields used by KH, with required `name` and `version`; it is not an exhaustive npm schema. Local profile readers use `Partial<KhPackageManifest>` because profiles need no published version. `KhManifest` describes only public author fields under `kh`. `KhBundleManifest.patch` is one patch file path or an ordered list of them, each relative to the package root; the launcher applies a list in order as one bundle layer. TypeScript checks the example and erases `import type`; these interfaces do not parse JSON or write a file.

The following metadata fields are optional. Omitting them leaves the format version or compatible host versions undeclared; readers do not infer defaults.

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `kh.manifestVersion` | Manifest format identifier; the declared format is `1`, independent of the npm package version and Session format version. |
| `engines.kh` | Author-declared compatible KH versions as a SemVer range, including exact prerelease versions. This field sits beside `engines.node` and `engines.npm`; an engines object may omit `kh`. |

`LocalizedText` carries literal text or a language map with a required English fallback. `PluginLocalizedMeta` carries optional display title, description, an image data URL resolved from a package root's `package.json.icon` or an exported `<specifier>/icon`, and metadata diagnostics for installed plugins. [App boot](../../boot/app-boot/README.md) reads these values; this package only supplies their types.

Public composition declarations are defined in [`src/types.ts`](src/types.ts). Internal `configTrees`, `sessionFormatMigration`, and generated `moduleFallback` metadata remain owned by their image-packer, catalog, and launcher readers; the public types do not expose them.

## Understand the implementation

<details>
<summary>Implementation internals — click to expand</summary>

The package root only re-exports declarations from [`src/types.ts`](src/types.ts).

## Further Exploration

- [Profile launcher](../../boot/app-boot/README.md#profiles) — manifest loading and composition.
- [Public package metadata](../../../.agents/notes/implemented/architecture/2026-09-10-public-package-manifest.md) — field placement and reader ownership.

<a id="model-experience"></a>
## Model Experience

None, as this package only exports types.

#### KV Cache effect

Type declarations add no model input, so provider cache reuse is unaffected.

## Known Limitations and Deferred Work

<a id="known-limitations-and-deferred-work"></a>

- **Static typing only.** Consumers read and validate the JSON fields they use, then adapt the shared declarations to their runtime data. The package supplies no parser, getter helpers, file checks, or defaults.
- **Compatibility is declarative.** Current installers and loaders do not enforce `kh.manifestVersion` or `engines.kh`; declaring a range does not reject incompatible hosts or validate SemVer syntax.
